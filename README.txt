This digital sound recorder deposits and withdraws voice data in SRAM by utilizing the MASTER_MODE in AUDIO_CODEC module. 

The SRAM capacity of the digital sound recorder is 2MB, which is able to record voice with 100+ seconds. The user can correct data directly or press a special key to perform editing functions, including pause for timing and modifying previous records.
In addition, the recorder provide a variety of playback speeds (1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), where zero- and first-order interpolation are optional while playing slow-forward.



###Note that the code should be run on FPGA DE2-115.###
